# JavaScript-Codes-V2

This repo contains short notes and all the codes that I have executed and assignments finished while learning Javascript
through "Namasate Javascript" playlist from youtube channel named Akshay Saini.

## This can be helpful for: 
          - Anyone intending to understand Javascript working behind the scenes for better clarity.
          - Someone who wants to upscale their js knowledge 
          - A beginner with atmost basic programming exposure in Javascript
## Recommendation :
          - if you are beginner in js and wants to revise just go through my another repo for basic javascript linked below
           [JavaScript-Codes-V1](https://github.com/JEEVAN-SKN/JavaScript-Codes-V1) https://jeevan-skn.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/ 
    
          - Go through the above repo coz I would not be explaining some basic concepts already discussed in above repo
