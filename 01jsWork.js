// everything in js happens inside the execution context
// it has 2 components 
// 1)Memory component(variable environment)
// 2)Code componen(Thread of Execution)

//1)  In memory component all variables and functions are stored in as key-value pairs

// 2) In Code component all the code is executed one line at a time(interpreted)

//   ** Javascript is a synchronous single threaded language*
// Here single threaded means that only one command is executed at a time
//  and synchronous means that these single commands are executed in a specific order 

//  Asynchronous parts comes in ajax and other stuff which we will discudd later
