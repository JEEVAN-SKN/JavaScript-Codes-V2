    // js can be applied almost anywhere, it canbe run in browser, server, smartwatch, lightbulb, robots and many more  
        //this is possible due to javascript runtime environment 
                //js runtime is like a container which has all the things to run javascript code
                    // js Runtime basically contains a)Js Engine(call stack)
                                                  // b) WebAPI
                                                  // c)event loop
                                                  // d) callback queue 
                                                  // e) microtask queue

            //all javascript execution in browser happens through this runtime environment 
        //Node js has its own runtime environment which helps to run js in servers
    //node js runtime and browser runtime has many similarities and dissimilarities 

// Now lets discuus the working of js engine 
        //there are a lot of js engines out there like chakra(micorsoft edge), Spidermonkey(firefox), V8(chrome, node.js, Deno, v8.net)
            //most important principle of a js engine is to follow the ECMA script standards
